Summary
=======

- Tracking devices are an important component of image-guided systems as they allow to track the position of different devices during a surgical procedure.
- There are three main types of tracking used in surgical room: mechanical, optical and electromagnetic. 
- Mechanical digitisers transform a mechanical movement into a digital measurement.
- Optical tracking requires a line-of-sight between the camera and the object tracked but provides a high accuracy and precision. 
- Electromagnetic tracking does not need to have a line-of-sight but it has other sources of errors such as a field distortion due to ferromagnetic materials placed nearby.
- There are also common errors such as the so-called lever-arm, static errors and dynamic errors. 
- The selection of a tracking system will depend on the surgical procedure and the expected accuracy.
