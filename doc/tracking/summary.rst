Summary
=======

Tracking devices are an important component of image-guided systems as they allow to track the position of different devices during a surgical procedure.
There are two main types of tracking: optical and electromagnetic tracking. Optical tracking requires a line-of-sight between the camera and the object tracked, while electromagnetic tracking does not need to have a line-of-sight but it has other sources of errors such as a field distortion due to ferromagnetic materials placed nearby.

The selection of a tracking device will depend on the surgical procedure and the expected accuracy.
