Introduction
============

Tracking devices allow to track the position of a tool or device relative to the patient anatomy during a surgical procedure. 

History
-------
* 1940s: A tracking system is used for the first time in humans. It is a sterotactic device and is used for neurological applications.
* 1960s: The benefits and accuracy of the stereotactic device becomes a standard practice.
* 1980s: Mechanical digitizers become popular due to their use in CAS, especially in neurosurgery. 
* 1990s: Optical trackers are introduced in order to overcome clinical problems of previous tracking systems such as the ability to track multiple devices and sterilisation issues, evolving to very accurate devices. On of the main limitations of optical trackers is the line-of-sight requirement between the tracked markers and the camera.
* Late 1990s, early 2000s: The introduction of electromagnetic trackers allows to track devices without requiring a line-of-sight.
