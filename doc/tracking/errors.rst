Errors and accuracy
===================

Introduction
------------
All tracking systems suffer from positional and rotational errors. 
  
Lever-arm effect error
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Rotational errors can have a big impact on the performance of the optical tracking system due to the so-called lever-arm effect, specially when the tracked marker lies further away from the tip of the tool that is being tracked. The lever-arm effect is the propagation of an error on the rotation measurement of the marker to the tool tip. The longer the distance between the marker and the tip of the tool, the larger the error may be.
