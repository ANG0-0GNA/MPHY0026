Visualisation And Multi-Modal Interaction
=========================================

Introduction

We have previously covered a section on :ref:`Graphics`, which
discusses some particular methods of how to draw information on the
screen.

holistic view that considers the user perspective including what the user is
trying to achieve, all the information presented, the methods of
interaction, and the complete feedback loop that informs the user
as to how the system is responding to their input.

now gives an overview of this topic:
