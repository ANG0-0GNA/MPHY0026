Usability Workshop
==================

Note: These workshops were impacted by the COVID-19 Pandemic, so we switched to things that could be completed at home.

1. Ann will provide a "Kitchen" usability worksheet to consolidate information from the lecture, and provide material for an on-line discussion.

As an alternative, if people are struggling to participate in the above discussion, then try
this Jupyter Notebook on `Using FLE to Compute TRE <../notebooks/TRE_Worksheet.html>`_
also linked on the :ref:`Notebooks` page.
