Workshop 4 - Usability Workshop
===============================

(Note: These workshops were impacted by the COVID-19 Pandemic, so we switched to things that could be completed at home).

1. Ann will provide a "Kitchen" usability worksheet to consolidate information from the lecture.
2. Matt has prepared a Jupyter Notebook on `Using FLE to Compute TRE <../notebooks/TRE_Worksheet.html>`_ also linked on the :ref:`Notebooks` page.
