Workshop 5 - User Interaction Methods
=====================================

Note: This workshops was impacted by the COVID-19 Pandemic.
Steve had planned a wonderful workshop on usability and different interfaces.
But it is heavily dependent on being in the Lab.

Currently, this will be postponed, and we will try to run it in May 2020, or next year.
