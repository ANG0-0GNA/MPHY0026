Mental Exercise / Discussion
----------------------------

Briefly discuss: How easy is it to deploy a new technique in the following scenarios:

* MRI pulse sequence programming
* Imaging based cross-sectional studies
* Imaging based longitudinal studies
* Image-Guided Surgery

i.e. each has its own complexity. We are not suggesting a competition, where
one type of research is deemed harder or easier!!!


Characteristics
---------------

* Patient specific
* Real-time in OR
* Time sensitive
* Safety critical
* Integration with workflow
* Multiple users and perspectives
