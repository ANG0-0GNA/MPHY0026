Background
==========

Overview
--------

1. What is Computer Assisted Surgery and Therapy?
2. System examples
3. A systems approach


Learning Objectives
-------------------

The student will learn:

1. to understand common terminology in the field
2. an appreciation of some historical examples and be able to name examples
3. to understand component parts and how they combine to form a complete system


Before The Lecture

The Lecture
-----------

Nomenclature
^^^^^^^^^^^^

You may see:

* CAS - Computer Assisted Surgery
* CAI - Computer Assisted Interventions
* IGS - Image-Guided Surgery
* IGI - Image-Guided Interventions
* IGT - Image-Guided Therapy


Interventional Radiology
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Historically, radiologists focus on

* image acquisition
* image interpretation

and Interventional Radiology (IR) or Vascular and Interventional Radiology (VIR)
focus on

* treatment with minimally invasive procedures
* direct use of imaging technology during a procedure, e.g. CBCT


Clinical Communities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

So, the correct use of "surgery" versus "intervention" depends
on which clinician you are speaking to.

In engineering terms, "intervention" is seen as broader, including surgery,
minimally invasive procedures and therapy.


Basic Components
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A computer assisted surgery (CAS) system normally comprises

* Imaging
* Tracking / Calibration
* Registration
* Segmentation
* Visualisation
* User interface
* Evaluation

So, this course is more about CAS than just using interventional imaging.
