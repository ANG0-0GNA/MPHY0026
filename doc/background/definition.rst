Nomenclature
^^^^^^^^^^^^

You may see:

* CAS - Computer Assisted Surgery
* CAI - Computer Assisted Interventions
* IGS - Image-Guided Surgery
* IGI - Image-Guided Interventions
* IGT - Image-Guided Therapy


Interventional Radiology
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Historically, radiologists focus on

* image acquisition
* image interpretation

and Interventional Radiology (IR) or Vascular and Interventional Radiology (VIR)
focus on

* treatment with minimally invasive procedures
* direct use of imaging technology during a procedure, e.g. CBCT


Clinical Communities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

So, the correct use of "surgery" versus "intervention" depends
on which clinician you are speaking to.

In engineering terms, "intervention" is seen as broader, including surgery,
minimally invasive procedures and therapy.
