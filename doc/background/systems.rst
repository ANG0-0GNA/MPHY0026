System Examples
===============

Learning Objectives
-------------------

Upon completion of this section, the student will

* Understand the system topology of several CAS systems


Introduction
------------

In this section, we walk through some specifically chosen papers, and
identify:

* the clinical need
* the engineering solution
* the component parts
* coordinate systems

What do the papers say about system accuracy, and how is accuracy measured.
Other considerations should include the types of images used for guidance, 
how the images are displayed to the surgeon, and how the user/surgeon 
interacts with the system.

See `Terry Peters <http://www.robarts.ca/terry-peters>`_ explaining :ref:`additional_resources:What is Image-Guided Surgery?`,
by way of some examples.

Pointer-Based 4 Quadrant View
-----------------------------

See classic papers such as [Galloway1993]_.
For an up-to-date example, see: :ref:`additional_resources:Examples - Image-Guided Surgery for Brain Tumours`.


Ultrasound On Video
-------------------

[Kang2014]_: Ultrasound Augmented Reality (AR) system for laparoscopic liver surgery.


Pre-op data In The Operating Microscope
---------------------------------------

[Edwards2000]_: The MAGI system, augmented reality in the operating microscope, for brain surgery.
