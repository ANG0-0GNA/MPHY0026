System Examples

Learning Objectives
-------------------

Upon completion of this section, the student will

* Understand the system topology of several CAS systems


Introduction
------------

In this section, we skim through some specifically chosen papers
to further understand some systems that have been developed
for CAS.

First though, Prof. Terry Peters gives examples from the Image-Guided Surgery Lab:

Pointer-Based 4 Quadrant View
-----------------------------

The 4-quadrant view with a pointer is the classic implementation of image-guidance, see [Galloway1993]_.

To see this in action:

By the end of Lecture 1, and Workshop 1, we will build our own!


Classroom Exercise
------------------

In groups of 1,2,3, take a skim through the following papers and identify:

* the clinical need
* the engineering solution
* the component parts
* coordinate systems (if you don't know what that is yet, skip it).

What do the papers say about system accuracy, and how is accuracy measured.
Other considerations should include the types of images used for guidance,
how the images are displayed to the surgeon, and how the user/surgeon
interacts with the system.

Gather round and present a summary to each other.


Ultrasound On Video
-------------------

[Kang2014]_: Ultrasound Augmented Reality (AR) system for laparoscopic liver surgery.


Pre-op data In The Operating Microscope
---------------------------------------

[Edwards2000]_: The MAGI system, augmented reality in the operating microscope, for brain surgery.

Pre-op data On Video
--------------------

[Prevost2019]_: The CASCination system. Similarly, [Thompson2015]_, with the UCL SmartLiver system, for laparoscopic liver surgery.
Here the CASCination paper is better for clinical pictures, but the Thompson paper shows the coordinate systems.

X-ray, CT guidance in the OR
----------------------------

[Feuerstein2008]_: TUM X-ray, CT system.

Freehand Ultrasound with MR
---------------------------

[Hu2016]_: Freehand ultrasound system for prostate biopsy.
