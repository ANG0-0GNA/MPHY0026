Summer School
=============

Introduction
------------

Welcome to a series of tutorials, developed for the
Medical Image Computing Summer School 2020 (`MedICSS`_).

Ordinarily, `MedICSS`_ is located at UCL and is based around the
Basic Augmented Reality Demo (`BARD`_). The `BARD`_ project demonstrates
augmenting a live video feed, with an overlay from a pre-operative scan.
This is a fairly typical scenario in medical augmented reality (AR).
However, `BARD`_ requires a physical phantom such as the
`pelvis phantom`_ in our lab at UCL.

So, in 2020, we developed a new series of tutorials
with the aim of exploring various components of an image-guided
surgery system.

These tutorials are:

  - :ref:`SummerSchoolCameraCalibration`
  - :ref:`SummerSchoolPivotCalibration`
  - :ref:`FidRegistrationTutorial`
  - :ref:`SummerSchoolOverlay`

Each tutorial should be fairly stand-alone, and suitable for completing at
home, or for distance learning.

Have fun!
