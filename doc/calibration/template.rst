Template-based tool calibration
===============================

Template-based tool calibration finds the transformation between a tracked marker/sensor and the tip of a tool (e.g., pointer). 
This method can be seen as an equivalent to pivot calibration.
This process consists in placing the surgical instrument in a tracked template with known geometry, in one or more positions. 
Then the spatial relationship can be found by acquiring one or more images.

Errors
------
The accuracy of this method mainly depends on how accurately the template is tracked in the acquired images.
The more images are acquired, the most likely the improvement in accuracy.
