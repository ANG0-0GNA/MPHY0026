Summary
=======

* Calibration is a process that finds unknown parameters relating different coordinates systems.
* In a CAI system there are several calibration processes that may need to be performed.
* The most common calibration processes in CAI are: pivot point calibration, hand-eye calibration and camera parameters calibration.
* Pivot point calibration finds the transformation between a tracked sensor/marker to the tip of a tool by pivoting the tool on a point.
* Camera parameters calibration finds the transformation between a 3D point and a 2D point, also by taking several images.
* Hand-eye calibration finds the transformation between a tracked sensor/marker and a camera by taking several images of the same point.
