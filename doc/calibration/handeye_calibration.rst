Hand-eye calibration
====================
Is the process of finding the transformation between the optical axis of the camera lens (camera intrinsic parameters and camera coordinate system) and the tracked marker/sensor.

  Hand-eye calibration

Free hand ultrasound calibration
--------------------------------
This procedure can also be used to perform a free hand ultrasound calibration, where we want to find the origin of the US image in respect to the tracked marker or sensor with high accuracy.
In order to achieve this, several calibration phantoms have been used (some of them are commercially available).

(see figure TBA)


Phantoms: Pointer stylus, single-wall, single line, lines in Z-configuration
