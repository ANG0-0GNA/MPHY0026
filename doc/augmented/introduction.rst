.. _AugmentedRealityIntro:

Introduction
============

In this chapter we cover "Augmented Reality" (AR).


AR is one type of display on the reality-virtuality continuum.
[Milgram1995]_ defines:

* Real Environment
* Augmented Reality (AR)
* Augmented Virtuality (AV)
* Virtual Environment

also mentioned in [KerstenOertel2013]_. The term Mixed Reality (MR)
refers to the two augmented cases AR, and VR.

The difference between AR and AV depends on whether the environment
is primarily Real with some computer generated augmentation, or
primarily Virtual with some representation of the real world.
