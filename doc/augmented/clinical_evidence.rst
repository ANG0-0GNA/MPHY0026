Clinical Evidence
=================

Much more work needs doing to validate if Augmented Reality is actually useful for surgery.

* There are papers that suggest how the technology is useful, e.g. [Guha2017]_ (Neurosurgery), [Bernhardt2017]_ (Laparoscopic Surgery)
* There are papers that show the benefits of individual components, e.g. [McIntire2014]_ for 3D displays

but what about actual clinical benefit?

Recently:

* [Dixon2012]_, "Surgeons blinded by enhanced navigation: the effect of augmented reality on attention"
* [Dilley2019]_, "Perfect Registration Leads to Imperfect Performance"
