Overview

There is a large body of literature, and many reviews, such as [Sharma2010]_. In this course, we cover some
classical methods [Sharma2010]_, statistical shape models [Heimann2009]_, and an example of
a more modern machine learning method [Ronneberger2015]_, which led to [Isensee2018]_ which won the
medical image decathlon challenge [Simpson2019]_.
