Calibration-Based Registration
==============================

Papers
^^^^^^

We studied two examples earlier. The point is, that by the time you have
done the system calibration, the necessary image modalities are aligned.

* Intra-op CT to laparoscopic video, as in [Feuerstein2008]_.
* Intra-op US, to laparoscopic video, as in [Kang2014]_.

For the sake of brevity, we will omit this for now, and you may revisit it after
the lectures on calibration.
